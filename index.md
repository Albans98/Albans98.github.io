*Hello and welcome to my personal website !*

My name is **Alban Steff** and I currently work at **Artelys to bring Data Science consultancy services** to a wide range of companies that need to develop efficient dashboards, models and use robust predictions. Prior to that, I worked as a **Data Scientist for Paris Greater University Hospitals (APHP)** to help radiologists analyze the data generated in routine care and at **Paris Brain Institute** to perform automatic segmentation of brain MRIs with Deep Learning.

I earned a Data Science degree at both **CentraleSup√©lec and ESILV** and a biomedical degree at **Paris-Saclay university.**

Feel free to navigate to the different sections to learn more about me and my work through reading the **Things I've Learned** section or visiting my online profiles **(Kaggle, LinkedIn, GitHub)**. If you need inspiration for your next Artificial Intelligence reading you can also read my **favourite online references !**
