Hello and welcome to my personal website ! 

My name is Alban Steff and I am a Data Scientist passionate about AI with experience using Python and R code to solve complex data problems through time series modeling, machine learning, text processing, deep learning and delivering models or dashboards through operational interfaces.

Feel free to navigate to the different sections to learn more about me and my work through reading my blog posts or visiting my online profiles (Kaggle, LinkedIn, GitHub). If you need inspiration for your next Artifical Intelligence reading you can also visit my favourite online references !

I currently work at Artelys to bring Data Science consultancy services to a wide range of companies that need to develop efficient dashboards, models and robust predictions.
